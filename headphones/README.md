Headphones Webpage – HTML & CSS Project

This project is a fully responsive static webpage built from scratch using only HTML and CSS. It is based on a Figma design provided by ALX, and the goal is to reproduce the layout as accurately as possible while following accessibility and responsive design principles.

Figma Design
